A micro hypervisor for RISC-V systems.

# Quick Start

## Building

```
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
cargo build
```

Note that Salus relies on unstable features from the nightly toolchain so there
may be build breakages from time-to-time. Try running `rustup upgrade` first
should you run into build failures.

## Running

There is a `Makefile` provided with targets for running various hosts in QEMU.

### Prerequisites

Toolchains:
- Rust: Install [rustup](rustup.rs), then: `rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`
- GCC: Install `gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf`

QEMU:
- Out-of-tree patches are required; see table below.
- Build using QEMU [instructions](https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux) with
  `--target-list=riscv64-softmmu`
- Set the `QEMU=` variable to point to the compiled QEMU tree when using the
  `make run_*` targets described below.

Linux kernel:
- Out-of-tree patches are required; see table below.
- Build: `ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- make defconfig Image`
- Set the `LINUX=` variable to point to the compiled Linux kernel tree when
  using the `make run_linux` and `make run_debian` targets described below.

Debian:
- Download and extract a pre-baked `riscv64-virt` image from https://people.debian.org/~gio/dqib/.
- Set the `DEBIAN=` variable to point to the extracted archive when using the
  `make run_debian` target described below.

### Linux VM

The `make run_linux` target will boot a bare Linux kernel as the host VM
that will panic upon reaching `init` due to the lack of a root filesystem.

To boot a more functional Linux VM, use the `make run_debian` target which
will boot a Debian VM with emulated storage and network devices using pre-baked
Debian initrd and rootfs images.

Example:

```
make run_debian \
    QEMU=<path-to-qemu-tree> \
    LINUX=<path-to-linux-tree> \
    DEBIAN=<path-to-pre-baked-image>
```

Once booted, the VM can be SSH'ed into with `root:root` at `localhost:7722`.

Additional emulated devices may be added with the `EXTRA_QEMU_ARGS` Makefile
variable. Note that only PCI devices using MSI/MSI-X will be usable by the VM.
`virtio-pci` devices may also be used with `iommu_platform=on,disable-legacy=on`
flags.

Example:

```
make run_debian ... \
     EXTRA_QEMU_ARGS="-device virtio-net-pci,iommu_platform=on,disable-legacy=on"
```

### Test VM

A pair of test VMs are located in `test-workloads`.

`tellus` is a target build with `cargo build --bin=tellus` that runs in VS mode
and provides the ability to send test API calls to `salus` running in HS mode.

`guestvm` is a test confidential guest. It is started by `tellus` and used for
testing the guest side of the TSM API.

A makefile shortcut is provided:

```
make run_tellus \
    QEMU=<path-to-qemu-tree>
```

This will build salus, tellus, and the guestvm then boot them with the
system-installed qemu.

### Host

Normally Linux, this is the primary operating system for the device running in
VS mode.

Responsibilities:
- Scheduling
- Memory allocation (except memory kept by firmware and salus at boot)
- Guest VM start/stop/scheduling via TEE TH-API provided by salus
- Device drivers and delegation

#### VMM

The virtual machine manager that runs in userspace of the host.

- qemu/kvm or crosvm
- configures memory and devices for guests
- runs any virtualized or para virtualized devices
- runs guests with `vcpu_run`.

### Guests

VS-mode operating systems started by the host.

- Can run confidential or shared workloads.
- Uses memory shared from or donated by the host
- scheduled by the host
- can start sub-guests
- Confidential guests use TG-API for salus/host services

### Salus

The code in this repository. An HS-mode hypervisor.

- starts the host and guests
- manages stage-2 translations and IOMMU configuration for guest isolation
- delegates some tasks such as attestation to u-mode helpers
- measured by the trusted firmware/RoT

### Firmware

M-mode code.

OpenSBI currently boots salus from the memory (0x80200000) where qemu loader
loaded it and passes the device tree to Salus.

The above instructions use OpenSBI inbuilt in Qemu. If OpenSBI needs to be
built from scratch, fw_dynamic should be used for `-bios` argument in the qemu
commandline.

### Vectors

Salus is able to detect if the CPU has the vector extensio. The same binary will 
run on processor with or without the vector exension, and will enable vector code
if the extension is present.
